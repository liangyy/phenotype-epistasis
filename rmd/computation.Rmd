# Computing intermediate phenotype

The predicted complex trait risk by GWAS summary statistic is used as intermediate genetic trait. LD pruning + p-value thresholding (P+T) is widely used but suffer from lack of effective SNPs. 

## P+T

LD pruning ($r^2$ < 0.2) followed by p-value thresholding with various threholds optimized by validation prediction accurarcy ($R^2$). One implementation can be found at [PRSice](http://prsice.info/)

## LDpred 

Consider LD effect in each block ($\sim M / 3000$) with various prior fraction of causal variants optimized by validation accuracy. One implementation can be found at [here](https://github.com/bvilhjal/ldpred) (also see [paper](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9297(15)00365-1))
