# Data

Go to [data](data.html)

## Intermediate GWAS

The candidate phenotypes/traits should be highly inheritable. The intuition is that it may capture one aspect of genetic background in an as informative as possible manner.

## Disease Phenotypes

1. WTCCC: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, bipolar disorder, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease
2. Autisum

# Computation

Go to [computation](computation.html).

## Computing intermediate phenotype

Methods available:
  * P+T
  * LDpred
  
## Testing interaction

Hypothesis testing under linear model.
