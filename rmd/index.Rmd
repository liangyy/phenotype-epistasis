## Intermediate GWAS

The candidate phenotypes/traits should be highly inheritable. The intuition is that it may capture one aspect of genetic background in an as informative as possible manner.

Here is a list of publicly available GWAS summary statistics [link](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads/summary-statistics).

## Disease Phenotypes

1. WTCCC: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, bipolar disorder, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease
2. Autism

## GWAS for PRS Validation

GWAS summary statistics that can be used to benchmark the validation of PRS calculation.

# Computation

Go to [computation](computation.html).

## Computing intermediate phenotype

Methods available:

* P+T
* LDpred
  
## Testing interaction

Hypothesis testing under linear model.
