# Summary

This page presents the results of analysis that have been done. Every section is one disease (phenotype of interest) and each subsection is the analysis for a particular intermediate trait. 

Every subsection presents the following information.

* Marginal association: 
    - $Y \sim I$
    - $Y \sim G_i$
    - $Y \sim I + G_i$
* Interaction test results based on functional subsetting
* Follow up comment on the results if any
