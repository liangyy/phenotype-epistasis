Options in effect:
	--noweb
	--bfile output-combine_XT_YT/geno1_case/chr2

Reading map (extended format) from [ output-combine_XT_YT/geno1_case/chr2.bim ] 
300 markers to be included from [ output-combine_XT_YT/geno1_case/chr2.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ output-combine_XT_YT/geno1_case/chr2.fam ] 
200 individuals read from [ output-combine_XT_YT/geno1_case/chr2.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 200 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 200 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 200 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
These individuals will be set to missing ( or use --allow-no-sex )
Writing list of these individuals to [ plink.nosex ]
Reading genotype bitfile from [ output-combine_XT_YT/geno1_case/chr2.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 300 SNPs
200 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 300 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 200 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 200 of unspecified sex
